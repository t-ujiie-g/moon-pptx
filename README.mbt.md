A pure-MoonBit library for reading, building, and writing PowerPoint
presentations (`.pptx` / OOXML), with a type-safe builder API.

## Vision

Where `python-pptx` succeeded, this project aims to **match its scope and go
further** while staying entirely within MoonBit:

- **Pure MoonBit** — works on Native and Wasm-GC backends with no FFI to
  host runtimes (depends only on `hustcer/fzip` for ZIP/DEFLATE).
- **Type-safe units** — `Emu`, `Pt`, `Inch`, `Cm`, `Color` are distinct types
  with explicit conversions; impossible to mix up.
- **Immutable builders** — `slide.with_shape(rect).with_text(tb)` returns a
  new value; no hidden mutation.
- **ADT-driven model** — `Fill`, `Stroke`, `Effect` are enums; pattern match
  instead of attribute soup.
- **Lossless round-trip** — unknown OOXML extensions are preserved verbatim.
- **Beyond `python-pptx`** — SmartArt builder, animation builder, all 13
  chart types as buildable, compile-time placeholder schema (planned).

See [TODO.md §8](TODO.md#8-comparison-vs-python-pptx-target-end-state) for the
full feature comparison.

## Install

Once published to mooncakes:

```bash
moon add t-ujiie-g/moon_pptx
```

## Quickstart (planned API — does not work yet)

```moonbit nocheck
///|
let prs = @moon_pptx.Presentation::new()

///|
let slide = prs
  .slides()
  .add(@moon_pptx.SlideLayout::title_and_content())
  .with_title("Hello, MoonBit")
  .with_body("This deck was built without touching XML.")

///|
let bytes = prs.save()
```

## Development

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `moon check` | Type check (run after every edit) |
| `moon test` | Run all tests on default backend |
| `moon test --target all` | Run tests across `native` / `wasm-gc` / `js` |
| `moon fmt` | Format code |
| `moon info` | Regenerate `.mbti` (public API surface) |
