## 0. Project at a glance

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Module ID | `t-ujiie-g/moon_pptx` |
| License | Apache-2.0 |
| MoonBit toolchain | `moon 0.1.20260427` (or newer) |
| Primary backend | TBD (lean **Native**; verify Wasm-GC also builds for browser users) |
| Buffer type | `FixedArray[Byte]` (matches fzip / MoonBit core convention) |
| Required deps | `hustcer/fzip` (DEFLATE + ZIP, pure MoonBit) |
| Reference prior art | `python-pptx` (Python), `pptx-svg` (read+render PoC by same author) |
| Differentiator vs `python-pptx` | Type-safe units, ADT-based fills/effects, immutable builders, plus features python-pptx lacks (SmartArt build, animation builder) |

### Out of scope (initially)
- Macros / VBA execution
- EMF/WMF rasterization (binary preserved on read; no creation)
- Animation playback (data round-trip only in early phases; build API later)
- Native PDF export

## 1. Vision & non-goals

### Vision
A MoonBit-first PPTX library that lets you **build a complete `.pptx` from
scratch**, **modify existing decks safely**, and **read every detail** of an
arbitrary PPTX — all without depending on any non-MoonBit runtime.

### Design pillars
1. **Pure MoonBit, mooncakes-publishable** — no FFI to host runtimes; works on Native and Wasm-GC backends from a single codebase.
2. **Type-safe units** — `Emu` / `Pt` / `Inch` / `Cm` are distinct types; conversions are explicit.
3. **Immutable builder API** — `Slide::new().with_shape(...).with_text(...)`; builders return new values, not mutated ones.
4. **ADT-driven model** — `Fill`, `Stroke`, `Effect`, `Shape` are enums/sealed traits; pattern match instead of attribute soup.
5. **Round-trip preservation** — unknown OOXML is preserved verbatim on read→write; we never silently drop data.
6. **Beyond python-pptx where it matters** — SmartArt builder, animation builder, type-safe layout/placeholder schema.

### Non-goals
- Be a drop-in Python replacement (no Python bindings in scope).
- Render to image/PDF (use a separate companion lib if needed).
- Support every legacy PPT (binary `.ppt`) feature.

```

### Naming conventions
- Public types: `PascalCase`. Modules and functions: `snake_case`.
- Builders return `Self` (or new value of `Self` for immutable style).
- Conversions: `from_*` / `to_*`. Fallible parse: `parse_*` returning `?` or raising.
- Errors: subdomain-specific `*Error` suberrors; never raw `String` errors.

### Multi-backend strategy
- **Default target**: Native (CLI / library users).
- **Verify**: Wasm-GC builds without changes (no FFI, only fzip + core).
- Avoid: Wasm-1 (legacy), JS backend unless explicitly requested.
- CI matrix should run on at least Native + Wasm-GC.

## 3. Phase roadmap

Phases are sequential. Each phase has a **definition of done (DoD)** that must
be met before moving on. Mark items `[x]` as completed and link the merge commit.

### Phase 0 — Bootstrap *(complete)*

DoD: empty project builds, fzip is a verified dependency, baseline test passes,
TODO.md is the living roadmap.

- [x] `moon new` scaffold (`t-ujiie-g/moon_pptx`)
- [x] `moon.mod.json` populated (description, keywords, repo, license)
- [x] `hustcer/fzip` v0.6.1 added as dep
- [x] `moon check` / `moon build` / `moon test` clean
- [x] fzip round-trip smoke test (`fzip_smoke_test.mbt`)
- [x] TODO.md drafted (this file)
- [x] README.md skeleton with vision + status badge (`README.mbt.md`)
- [x] CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): check / fmt / info-drift on Ubuntu+macOS, plus test matrix across `native` / `wasm-gc` / `js`
- [x] Backend matrix decision recorded (see ADR-002: Accepted — Native primary, Wasm-GC and JS verified in CI; LLVM and legacy Wasm excluded)
- [x] CLAUDE.md (Claude Code overlay) and AGENTS.md (tool-agnostic) authored; both reference TODO.md as the source of truth
- [x] MoonBit official skills documented as required Claude Code plugin (`moonbitlang/skills` marketplace → `moonbit-skills`)
- [ ] First commit pushed to `origin/main` (awaiting user authorization)

### Phase 1 — Foundations: units & XML

DoD: a developer can express any OOXML primitive value (units, colors, qnames)
in MoonBit, and serialize/parse arbitrary XML round-trip without data loss.

- [ ] `units` package
  - [ ] `Emu` (Int64), `Pt`, `Inch`, `Cm` newtypes with conversion
  - [ ] Conversion table tested: 914400 EMU = 1 inch = 72 pt = 2.54 cm
  - [ ] `Percentage` (Int, 1/1000 %)
  - [ ] `Angle` (Int, 1/60000 deg) — used for rotation, gradient angles
- [ ] `units::color`
  - [ ] `RgbColor`, `HslColor`, conversions
  - [ ] `ThemeColor` enum (12 slots: bg1/2, tx1/2, accent1..6, hlink, folHlink)
  - [ ] `SchemeColor` modifiers: tint, shade, sat/lum mod
- [ ] `xml` package
  - [ ] Streaming writer with namespace handling and attribute escaping
  - [ ] Event-based reader (start/end/text/cdata) tolerating real-world OOXML
  - [ ] `QName` type (prefix + local) with namespace map
  - [ ] Round-trip test: read complex XML, write it back byte-near-equal
  - [ ] Decision: parse to DOM, or stay event-only? (recommend event + ad-hoc DOM helpers)

---

### Phase 2 — OPC layer over fzip

DoD: read/write a PPTX (or any OPC package) at the part-and-relationship level.
You can `Package::open(bytes)`, list parts, pick `[Content_Types].xml`, write
back, and the result is openable in PowerPoint.

- [ ] `opc::Package` struct
  - [ ] `open(bytes : FixedArray[Byte]) -> Package raise OpcError`
  - [ ] `to_bytes() -> FixedArray[Byte]`
  - [ ] `parts() -> Array[Part]` and `part_by_name(name) -> Part?`
- [ ] `opc::Part`
  - [ ] `name : String` (PartName, starts with `/`)
  - [ ] `content_type : String`
  - [ ] `bytes : FixedArray[Byte]` and `text() : String`
- [ ] `opc::Relationship` and `opc::Relationships`
  - [ ] Relationship targets, types, IDs
  - [ ] Helper: traverse from main `presentation.xml` outward
- [ ] `opc::ContentTypes`
  - [ ] Default and Override entries
  - [ ] Auto-update on add/remove of parts
- [ ] Round-trip test: load a real `.pptx` from `test_fixtures/`, dump and reload,
      ensure all parts and rels survive byte-equal (modulo XML formatting).

---

### Phase 3 — Read path: parse OOXML to model

DoD: parse a non-trivial PPTX into our typed model (`Presentation`, `Slide`,
`Shape`, …) with **lossless preservation** of unknown XML chunks.

- [ ] Theme parser (`a:theme`)
- [ ] Slide master / layout parsers + inheritance resolver
- [ ] Slide parser: shapes, group shapes, connectors, pictures, tables, charts
- [ ] Text parser: paragraph, run, list style, font, hyperlink
- [ ] Fill / stroke / effect parsers
- [ ] Geometry parser (preset + custom)
- [ ] Chart XML parser (read all 13 types as data — creation comes later)
- [ ] Speaker notes, comments
- [ ] **Unknown-element preservation strategy** decided and implemented
      (recommend: every model node carries `extension : Array[XmlElement]`)
- [ ] End-to-end test: open 3+ real-world decks, dump model, no panics, no data loss

---

### Phase 4 — Write path: serialize model to OOXML

DoD: any model produced by Phase 3 reads can be re-serialized and reopened by
PowerPoint with no warnings or visual diffs.

- [ ] Per-element writers (mirror parsers from Phase 3)
- [ ] Auto-generation of `[Content_Types].xml` and rels from model
- [ ] Numeric ID assignment (shape IDs, rId, etc.) is deterministic
- [ ] Round-trip golden test: read sample, write back, byte-equal after canonical XML pass
- [ ] PowerPoint open verification: manual checklist for sample decks
- [ ] LibreOffice open verification (cross-implementation sanity)

---

### Phase 5 — Builder API: create from scratch

DoD: a user can produce a multi-slide deck with text, shapes, and pictures **without
ever touching XML**, starting from `Presentation::new()`.

- [ ] Embedded blank-template `.pptx` bytes (`template/blank.pptx`)
  - [ ] Choose minimal but valid template (one master, one layout, one slide)
  - [ ] Verify PowerPoint opens it with no warnings
- [ ] `Presentation::new() -> Presentation`
- [ ] `Presentation::open(bytes) -> Presentation raise PptxError`
- [ ] `Presentation::save() -> FixedArray[Byte]`
- [ ] `Presentation::slides() -> SlideCollection`
- [ ] Builder methods (immutable):
  - [ ] `slides.add(layout : SlideLayout) -> Slide`
  - [ ] `slide.with_shape(s : Shape) -> Slide`
  - [ ] `TextBox::new().with_text(...).with_font(...)`
  - [ ] `Rectangle::new().at(x,y).size(w,h).with_fill(...)`
  - [ ] `Picture::from_bytes(...)`, `Picture::from_path(...)` (Native only)
- [ ] Type-safe layout selection (placeholder schema as type parameter — stretch goal)
- [ ] Cookbook example: build a 5-slide pitch deck end-to-end

---

### Phase 6 — Tables

DoD: create, modify, and read tables matching python-pptx feature parity.

- [ ] Table builder: `Table::new(rows, cols).at(...).size(...)`
- [ ] Cell merging (grid_span, row_span)
- [ ] Cell text, fill, borders, margins
- [ ] Table styles
- [ ] Read existing tables losslessly

---

### Phase 7 — Charts (creation)

DoD: create `bar`, `line`, `pie` charts from data; read all 13 types losslessly.

- [ ] Phase 7a: read all 13 chart types into `ChartData` (already designed for in Phase 3)
- [ ] Phase 7b: write `bar`, `line`, `pie` from-scratch
- [ ] Phase 7c: write `scatter`, `area`, `radar`, `bubble`
- [ ] Phase 7d: remaining types (`stock`, `surface`, `waterfall`, `treemap`, `sunburst`, `histogram`, `boxwhisker`, `funnel`)
- [ ] Series, categories, axes, legend, data labels, trendlines
- [ ] Embedded XLSX cache generation (charts reference an embedded spreadsheet)

---

### Phase 8 — Differentiators (beyond python-pptx)

DoD: at least two features that python-pptx does not offer in builder form.

- [ ] **SmartArt builder**: layout templates + node tree → DiagramML
- [ ] **Animation builder**: timeline DSL for entrance/emphasis/exit/motion
- [ ] **Compile-time placeholder schema**: `slide<TitleAndContent>().title("…").content("…")` with type errors if you set an unsupported placeholder
- [ ] **Streaming write** for huge decks (avoid materializing whole XML in memory)

---

### Phase 9 — Polish, docs, release

DoD: 1.0.0 publishable to mooncakes with stable API surface.

- [ ] API stability review (mark experimental APIs)
- [ ] mbti generated public API stable
- [ ] README with quickstart, examples, comparison vs python-pptx
- [ ] `examples/` covers common scenarios
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md following Keep-a-Changelog
- [ ] Tag `v1.0.0` and `moon publish`

## 4. Architecture decision records (ADRs)

Append-only. Each decision gets a heading, date, status, context, decision, consequences.

### ADR-001: Use `hustcer/fzip` for ZIP/DEFLATE
- **Date**: 2026-05-10
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: PPTX is a ZIP container. We need pure-MoonBit ZIP read/write.
- **Decision**: Depend on `hustcer/fzip` v0.6.1 (released 2026-05-09). Pure MoonBit, fflate-derived, 220+ tests, actively maintained, security-hardened.
- **Consequences**: Saves 1–3 months of self-implementing DEFLATE. Bound to fzip's API and maintenance cadence — acceptable since fzip is shipping multiple releases per week and the API surface we use is small.

### ADR-002: Native primary; Wasm-GC + JS verified in CI; LLVM and legacy Wasm excluded
- **Date**: 2026-05-10
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: "MoonBit-only library" rules out reliance on a JS host. Native gives us file I/O directly; Wasm-GC enables browser embedding; JS is a useful escape hatch. LLVM is nightly-only (per `moonbit-orientation` skill); legacy Wasm is superseded by Wasm-GC.
- **Decision**: Develop and test against Native first. CI matrix runs `moon test` against `native`, `wasm-gc`, and `js`. Avoid backend-specific features without abstraction. Phase-0 smoke test confirmed all three targets pass.
- **Consequences**: All file I/O goes through `bytes`-level APIs at the public surface; convenience helpers (`Presentation::open_path`) live behind backend gates. Any feature that cannot be expressed cross-backend requires an ADR before adoption.

### ADR-003: Immutable builders over mutable setters
- **Date**: 2026-05-10
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Context**: python-pptx uses mutable attribute setters. MoonBit idioms favor immutability and explicit transformation.
- **Decision**: Builders return new values: `slide.with_shape(s)` not `slide.add_shape(s)`. Where mutation is necessary (e.g., editing existing decks), provide `_mut` variants explicitly.
- **Consequences**: Slightly more allocation; clearer dataflow; safer with concurrency.

### ADR-004: Lossless preservation of unknown XML
- **Date**: 2026-05-10
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Context**: OOXML has many extension elements (Office variants, third-party). Dropping unknowns silently corrupts files for users.
- **Decision**: Every parsed model node carries an `extension : Array[XmlElement]` capturing children we did not recognize. Writers emit them back verbatim.
- **Consequences**: Slightly heavier model; full round-trip safety even for incomplete coverage.

### ADR-005: Single root package vs sub-packages
- **Date**: 2026-05-10
- **Status**: Pending
- **Context**: fzip uses a single flat package; pptx-svg uses sub-packages. Trade-off: discoverability (single) vs encapsulation (multiple).
- **Decision**: TBD. Lean toward sub-packages by Phase 1 because the surface area will be much larger than fzip's.
- **Consequences**: Decide before Phase 1 or refactor cost grows.

### ADR-006: TODO.md as single source of truth; no separate planning docs
- **Date**: 2026-05-10
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: AI-driven development can scatter intent across many auxiliary docs (plans, designs, reviews). This rots quickly.
- **Decision**: All roadmap, scope, ADRs, open questions, and risk tracking live in `TODO.md`. Tool-agnostic contributor guidance lives in `AGENTS.md`; Claude-specific overlay in `CLAUDE.md`. New planning, decision, or analysis files are not created — append to `TODO.md` instead.
- **Consequences**: One file to keep current. PRs that change scope must update `TODO.md` in the same change.

### ADR-007: MoonBit official skills required for Claude Code workflow
- **Date**: 2026-05-10
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Claude Code's behavior on MoonBit code improves dramatically when the official `moonbitlang/skills` plugin is loaded (orientation, agent-guide, refactoring, spec-test).
- **Decision**: Required Claude Code plugins are documented in `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`. Contributors install via `/plugin` add marketplace `moonbitlang/skills` then install `moonbit-skills`.
- **Consequences**: Claude Code work without the plugin loaded is best-effort only. Contributors using other agents (Codex, OpenCode, Cursor) follow the install instructions in the upstream skills repo.

## 5. Open questions

| # | Question | Owner | Needed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Confirm Native backend works with all needed MoonBit core APIs (esp. Int64 for EMU) | — | end of Phase 0 |
| Q2 | XML reader: build our own minimal parser or look for a mooncakes XML lib? | — | start of Phase 1 |
| Q3 | How do we ship the embedded blank template (binary file vs hex literal in source)? | — | start of Phase 5 |
| Q4 | Which real-world `.pptx` files do we use as fixtures, given license/copyright concerns? | — | end of Phase 2 |
| Q5 | Chart embedded XLSX — do we generate it or treat as opaque cache? | — | start of Phase 7 |
| Q6 | How do we expose backend differences (Native file APIs vs Wasm-GC byte-only) cleanly? | — | start of Phase 5 |

---

## 6. Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| OOXML coverage explodes scope (chart, smartart, animation are huge specs) | High | High | Phase gating; release at Phase 5 (text/shapes/picture) as v0.5; charts later |
| MoonBit compiler/breaking changes | Medium | Medium | Pin moon version in CI; track changelogs |
| fzip breaking changes | Low | Low | Pin minor version; smoke test catches regressions early |
| PowerPoint vs LibreOffice rendering differences for our output | Medium | Medium | Manual verification matrix in Phases 4–5 |
| Performance: large decks trigger `Int` overflow in EMU math | Medium | High | Use `Int64` for EMU from day one (units phase) |
| API churn discourages early adopters | Medium | Medium | Mark APIs experimental until Phase 9; SemVer 0.x freely |

---

## 7. Workflow & conventions

### Development loop
```
moon check    # type check (fast)
moon test     # run all tests
moon fmt      # format
moon info     # regenerate pkg.generated.mbti
```

Run all four before committing. CI enforces them.

### Commit style
- Imperative subject line, ≤72 chars.
- Body explains *why*, not *what*.
- Reference TODO.md phase/section when applicable: `phase 1: add Emu newtype`.

### Testing
- Every public function has at least one test.
- Round-trip tests are mandatory at every layer (XML, OPC, OOXML, model).
- Real-world PPTX fixtures live in `test_fixtures/` (small, license-clear).

### Documentation
- Public APIs documented with `///` doc comments.
- Examples in `examples/` are runnable and tested.
- TODO.md is updated *in the same PR* as scope changes.

## 9. Living changelog (high-level)

- **2026-05-10** — Project bootstrapped; fzip dependency wired up; smoke test green.
- **2026-05-10** — Phase 0 closed: README, CI matrix (Ubuntu+macOS × native/wasm-gc/js), CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, ADR-006 (TODO.md as single source of truth), ADR-007 (MoonBit skills required). ADR-002 accepted.
- **2026-05-10** — CI fix: added `moon update` step before `moon check` / `moon test`. First push surfaced "Failed to resolve registry dependency `hustcer/fzip`" because fresh runners have no registry index until `moon update` populates it. Fix verified locally by wiping `.mooncakes/` and reproducing.

(Detailed changelog: `CHANGELOG.md`, populated from Phase 9 onward.)
